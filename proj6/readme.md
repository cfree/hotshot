# Project 6 - Extending Chrome with jQuery

### Notes
- The screenshot on p153 is not the same output expected from following the objective. 
- These project are great to develop debugging skills
- Indentation on p167 not consistent, hard to read
- template.html: Variables have `<` prefix in completed code instead of `:` as shown in book
- content.js: At `person` variable declaration, on p161 book uses `microdata.eq(i)` while completed code shows `people.eq(i)`

### Questions

### Status
Debugging...

### Problems
- Seems like manifest is ignoring content.js
