# Notes:

## Project 4 - Bounty Hunter
- Will need to use a web server, not a file
- Can't use the jQuery included with the book files (as with the previous projects) because jQuery Mobile isn't compitable w/ jQuery 1.9 and above
- Why not use chaining on the $(document) object?

Progress: Stopped on page 104, Mini Debriefing
