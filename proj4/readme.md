# Project 4 - Bounty Hunter notes

- Will need to use a web server, not a file
- Can't use the jQuery included with the book files (as with the previous projects) because jQuery Mobile isn't compitable w/ jQuery 1.9 and above
- Why not use chaining on the $(document) object?
- Template debugging - DO NOT LIKE
	- Ensure all template tags have a closing `}}`
- Missing
	- Error handling of 0 results
	- Back button on list page to go back to search screen
