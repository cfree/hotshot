# Project 7 - BYOjQuery

### Notes
- Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and use that to manage the dependencies. Seriously.
- Github no longer uses the `git://` protocol. Uses `https://` for read-only instead
	- `git://` still works, so whatever
- p187 - `git checkout 1.8.3` creates a new branch off of `master`. This is because there is no 1.8.3 branch to check out too, only a 1.8.3 tag. Unsure how to check out to a specific tag.
- As advertised, it basically (quickly) teaches you how to build custom version of jQuery. Chapter doesn't really go into much detail on the various technologies leveraged. It touches on each of them, giving you a fair introduction and just enough knowledge to get through the exercise. I feel like I could spend a chapter diving deep on each technology, progressively building on the last.
